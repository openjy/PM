# AKASHA Handbook

This handbook was written to serve as a set of guidelines for our core team members and community collaborators on anything related to our culture, processes, practices, roles, and rituals.

We believe that a very well defined set of guidelines is crictial to thrive in a self-organizing environment, as they help each one of us to move deliberately but with a shared vision and shared goals - and without acidentally 'breaking' anything. 

Also, a well defined set of guidelines helps us to deliver awesome rock-solid products :-)

**This hanbook is a continuous work-in-progress. Please, do help to improve it and keep it up to date!**
