# About AKASHA 

## Advanced Knowledge Architecture for Social Human Advocacy

As a word, AKASHA ( [aːkaːʃə], आकाश) has roots in Sanskrit and means “ether” in both its elemental and metaphysical senses.

The ancient Sanskrit-speaking civilization envisioned akasha as a metaphysical information network connecting humanity with itself and infinite knowledge. In this paradigm, thoughts, ideas, feelings, and experiences are stored forever and shared through akasha, the universal database connecting multiple planes of existence.

In today’s blockchain realm, AKASHA is a social and technological experiment enabling our collective memory, feelings and ideas to echo freely throughout humanity’s existence. By fusing Ethereum with the Inter-Planetary File System, we explore the implications and applications of a permanent Web in the context of freedom of expression, creative perpetuity, and privacy for a better home of Mind.

## What inspired us to take action

We believe that freedom of expression, access to information, and privacy are fundamental human rights that should be respected on the Internet as well as in real life. Through AKASHA, we want to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve this by enshrining basic human rights in code and approaching things differently.

It won’t happen overnight and we don’t have all the answers; it will take genius and hard work to get it right. But even if we don’t know everything from the start, we know something - basic human rights such as freedom of expression and privacy must be part of the solution(s). Otherwise, they’re not good solutions.

It’s not information that wants to be free – it’s us.
