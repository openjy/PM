# Communication Guidelines

## Preferred Communication Methods

- Since we're a distributed team, all relevant info should be recorded in one of our official tools, so everyone has equal access to it.
- To ask or discuss general topics, the appropriate Discord channel is your best option.
- To report a bug, or to suggest a new feature, or to simply discuss anything related to a feature or bug, use GitHub, either commenting in the respective issue or creating a new one.
- Avoid using emails. We believe that discussions over emails are counterproductive. 
- Definitively avoid even more sending and replying emails to multiple people and group email address, e.g. everyone@email.com. 

## Embrace Asynchronous

-
-
- Always reply messages waiting for your by the end of your workday.

## General Guidelines

- Keep your profiles updated. Give your colleagues an easy way to check your time zone, your email address, and, if you'd like, your personal website/portfolio/social media profiles.
- During your working hours, your Discord status should be either `Online` or `Do Not Disturb` , so your colleagues know you're around in case they need to get in touch with you. 
- Default to public channels: when in doubt, always post a message where everyone can read it. Keep everyone updated on stuff that is not private!
- Communicate proactively: when you ping someone, go ahead and give that person all the context they’ll need in order to get back to you when they can (e.g., no need to message “Hi Joel!” and then wait for a reply before saying more). Do include links, docs, your deadline or desired response time, anything that can move the conversation forward asynchronously.
