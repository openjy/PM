## Code Review 

Reviewing code is at least as important as writing it in the first place. Reviewing someone else's code is a not just a technical task, it's also a human one. Human tasks are always delicate.

The aim of a code review is to make the code better, to detect bugs before merging and delivering, and in addition, to improve maintainability of a given code base.
