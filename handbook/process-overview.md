## Code Review 

Reviewing code is at least as important as writing it in the first place. Reviewing someone else's code is a not just a technical task, it's also a human one. Human tasks are always delicate.

The aim of a code review is to make the code better, to detect bugs before merging and delivering, and in addition, to improve maintainability of a given code base.

Please, refert to [Code Review Code of Conduct](https://github.com/AkashaProject/PM/blob/master/handbook/code-review-conduct.md), [Code Review Best Practices](https://github.com/AkashaProject/PM/blob/master/handbook/code-review-practices.md) and [Code Review Checklist](https://github.com/AkashaProject/PM/blob/master/handbook/code-review-checklist.md) to know more about our Code Review code of conduct and practices.
