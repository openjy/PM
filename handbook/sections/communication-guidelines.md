# Communication Guidelines

## General Guidelines

- Communicate proactively! 
- All work information, including discussions and decisions, should flow through our communication and documentation tools only, in order to give everyone equal easy and systmatic access to it.
- Keep your profiles updated. Give your colleagues an easy way to check your time zone, your email address, and, _if you'd like_, your personal website/portfolio/social media profiles.
- Keep your calendar updated to make it easier to others scheduling meetings and catch ups with you. If you won't be at the your workplace during your default working hours, make that explicit in your calendar. 
- During your working hours, your Discord status should be either `Online` or `Do Not Disturb` , so your colleagues know you're around in case they need to get in touch with you. 
- Default to public channels: when in doubt, always post a message where all the core team can read it. Keep everyone updated on stuff that is not private!
 
## Preferred Communication Methods

- Communicate proactively! 
- To ask or discuss general topics, the appropriate Discord channel is your best option.
- To report a bug or to suggest a new feature, use GitHub, either commenting in an existent, related issue or creating a new one.
- Avoid using emails. We believe that discussions over emails are counterproductive. 
- Definitively avoid even more sending and replying emails to multiple people and group email address, e.g. everyone@email.com. 

## Embrace Asynchronous

- When you ping someone, go ahead and give that person all the context they’ll need in order to get back to you when they can (e.g., no need to message “Hi Mihai!” and then wait for a reply before saying more). Do include links, docs, your deadline or desired response time, anything that can move the conversation forward asynchronously.
- Whenever possible, reply waiting messages by the end of your workday at the latest.
- Communicate proactively ;-)
