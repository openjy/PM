# Communication Community

## Principles to manage Community Communication

- Return customer inquiries ASAP, no matter how big or small the matter.
- Listen to customers and seek to understand their point of view, no matter how vocal they may be.
- Be proactive in reaching out about potential issues versus waiting for the community to act first.
- Over-communicate as often as possible to ensure both AKASHA and the community are always on the same page.
- Always be appreciative :pray:
