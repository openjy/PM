# OKRs: Objectives and Key Results

## What are OKRs?

OKR is an abbreviation for Objective & Key Result. The concept was invented at the Intel Corporation and is widely used amongst the biggest technology companies in the world.

OKRs are meant to set strategy and goals over a specified amount of time for an organization and teams. At the end of that amount of time, the OKRs provide a reference to evaluate how well we did in executing our objectives.

Eeffective OKRs are widely shared and meant to be understood by teams and individuals. They serve as a communication framework for directing groups to solve complex challenges with constraints. 

### Objectives

Any initiative has an objective. The goal of setting an objective is to write out what you hope to accomplish such that at a later time you can easily tell if you have reached, or have a clear path to reaching, that objective.

Choosing the right objectives is one of the hardest things to do and requires a great deal of thinking and courage.

### Key Results

Assuming your Objectives are well thought through, Key Results are the secret sauce to using OKRs. Key Results are numerically-based expressions of success or progress towards an Objective.

The important element here is measuring success. It’s not good enough to make broad statements about improvement (that are subjectively evaluated). We need to know how well you are succeeding. Qualitative goals tend to under-represent our capabilities because the solution tends to be the lowest common denominator.

e.g If I create a goal to “launch new training for the sales team” I might do that for one sales member. If I alternatively make a Key Result of “train 50 sales team members” and only train 10, I’ve still 10x-ed my original goal.

## Guidelines to define OKRs

### First: the big picture

1. **What is your company mission?** 
   - You should already have a mission. 
   - Take the time to set a company mission
2. **What is the theme for the year going to be, the one big objective you (as a company) would like to accomplish?**
3. **What are three metrics that would tell you that you had indeed succeeded in that objective ?**
4. Check: 
       - Is the Objective inspirational and challenging? 
       - Are these tough KRs? 
       - Do you have only a 50/50 chance of making each KR?
       - Will it really take a year to do this?  
       - Does it tie together everyone’s efforts?
5. **What is one big objective toward your company mission that would take the company 3 months to do, and you are only 50% confident you could do?**
   - Gather ideas for this from team. 
   - Successful OKRS are set together, not handed down. 
6. **What are three metrics that would tell you that you had indeed succeeded?**
7. Check:
    - Is the Objective inspirational and challenging? 
    - Are these tough KRs? 
    - Do you have only a 50/50 chance of making each KR?
    - Will it really take an entire quarter to do this?  
    -Does it tie together everyone’s efforts?

### Then: for each group/function, i.e. marketing, engineering, product, design

1. **What Objective and three Key Results will you set to support the company OKR?**
2. Check:
    - Are these things you can do without support of other groups? 
    - Are your results actually results, or are they tasks you do to get results? 
       - e.g. Launch a pricing page vs launch a pricing page that has 12% conversion to contact.
    - CEO: do you really believe these will take a full quarter and each KR has only a 50/50 chance of success?
3. **What Objective and three Key Results will you PERSONALLY set to support the company OKR this quarter?**
    - e.g learn new skills, hire great people, show results in your pet project
4. **What big projects are needed to make this happen?**  
   - It becomes the **roadmap**.
   - They are tasks
   - List as many as you wish
   - You can reorder them as often as needed through the quarter to hit the OKRs
   - OKRs don’t change (strategy) but projects and priorities do (tactics). [Validation](http://eleganthack.com/customer-development-with-participatory-roadmaps/)
5. **What steps are taken to make projects happen (priorities) this week!**  
    - will be shared and set weekly in a planning meeting and in email
