# OKRs: Objectives and Key Results

## What are OKRs?

OKR is an abbreviation for Objective & Key Result. The concept was invented at the Intel Corporation and is widely used amongst the biggest technology companies in the world.

OKRs are meant to set strategy and goals over a specified amount of time for an organization and teams. At the end of that amount of time, the OKRs provide a reference to evaluate how well we did in executing our objectives.

Eeffective OKRs are widely shared and meant to be understood by teams and individuals. They can serve as a communication framework for directing groups to solve complex challenges with constraints. As a communication tool, OKRs bring two key things to an organization:

- Easily digestible direction such that every member in the organization understands how they contribute to the mission; aka focus.
- Expectations amongst teams and their individual members; aka accountability.

### Objectives

Any initiative has an objective. The goal of setting an objective is to write out what you hope to accomplish such that at a later time you can easily tell if you have reached, or have a clear path to reaching, that objective.

Choosing the right objectives is one of the hardest things to do and requires a great deal of thinking and courage to do well.

### Key Results

Assuming your Objectives are well thought through, Key Results are the secret sauce to using OKRs. Key Results are numerically-based expressions of success or progress towards an Objective.

The important element here is measuring success. It’s not good enough to make broad statements about improvement (that are subjectively evaluated). We need to know how well you are succeeding. Qualitative goals tend to under-represent our capabilities because the solution tends to be the lowest common denominator.

e.g If I create a goal to “launch new training for the sales team” I might do that for one sales member. If I alternatively make a Key Result of “train 50 sales team members” and only train 10, I’ve still 10x-ed my original goal.
